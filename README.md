Read Me Generator:
This command-line application powered by jQuery and Node.js dynamically generates a README.md file based on prompted user inputs, given the user has a Github profile and repository. The generator is initiated by entering the following command in your command terminal: 'node index.js'. Users are prompted for their Github username and other repo-specific information, creating a neatly formatted README file with a table of contents. When creating a new project on Github, this README generator provides a simple, quick generation of a high-quality README file. This app will allow the project creator and other collaborators to maximize efficiency during project development.
